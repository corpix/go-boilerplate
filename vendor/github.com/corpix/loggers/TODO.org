* DONE Implement prefix wrapper
  CLOSED: [2017-08-23 Wed 06:56]
* DONE Rename to loggers
  CLOSED: [2017-08-23 Wed 07:49]
* DONE Implement fallback logger as separate logger
  CLOSED: [2017-08-23 Wed 08:07]
  At this moment this is impossible because we have no knowledge
  about the state of the upstream logger. It should return some error
  but this is restricted by interface signature. We could panic but
  this solution is shit.
  Wontfix.
* DONE Migrate nsq to fallback logger
  CLOSED: [2017-08-23 Wed 08:09]
  Because fallback logger will not get implemented this feature is wontfix.
* DONE Create logger from some configuration struct
  CLOSED: [2017-11-09 Thu 15:09]
  This should be resolved on the constructor level, at this time
  it is not critical. If in future someone write code for this I'll
  upstream it.
* DONE Fix prefixwrapper
  CLOSED: [2017-11-09 Thu 15:08]
  Variadic arguments wrapped with `[]interface{}` for each level of prefixwrapper:

  Here we have 2 levels of prefixwrapper

  #+BEGIN_SRC text
  DEBU[0000] bitfinex: TickerConsumer: Handshaked
  DEBU[0000] bitfinex: TickerConsumer: Will subscribe to pairs: [[[]]]
  DEBU[0000] bitfinex: TickerConsumer: Preamble complete, channels subscribed: []interface {}{[]interface {}{bitfinex.symbolPairByChannel{}}}

* DONE Logger interface should migrate under logger package
  CLOSED: [2017-11-09 Thu 12:50]
  No, it is ok to hame it under loggers.Logger
