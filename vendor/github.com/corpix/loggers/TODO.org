* DONE Implement fallback logger as separate logger
  CLOSED: [2017-08-23 Wed 08:07]
  At this moment this is impossible because we have no knowledge

  but this is restricted by interface signature. We could panic but
  this solution is shit.
  Wontfix.
* DONE Migrate nsq to fallback logger
  CLOSED: [2017-08-23 Wed 08:09]
